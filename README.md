# cs550nn

Course project exploring use of CUDA in neural networks.

Note: none of us participated in writing the original versions of cuANN or genann. cuANN is by
'alexge233' and genann is by 'codeplea.' We are merely building off of these repositories for a course project and using git to collaborate. For the original versions of these repositories, please visit:
cuANN: https://github.com/alexge233/cuANN
genann: https://github.com/codeplea/genann
