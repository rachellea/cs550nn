# cs550nn

Course project exploring use of GPUs for neural network training, convolution, and linear algebra. 

Neural networks: Bill and Rachel wrote and profiled a CUDA implementation of a neural network, based on "Genann." Genann is a neural network originally written in ANSI C by 'codeplea.' For the original C implementation you can visit https://github.com/codeplea/genann.

Convolution: All CUDA convolution code was written and analyzed by Lesia. The convolution code was not based on any other libraries or repositories.

Linear Algebra: The code for matrix multiplication and factorization were obtained from LINK, LINK, LINK, and LINK. These algorithms were profiled by Ben and Parker.

Note: we also have a copy of cuANN in this repository. CuANN was written by 'alexge233': https://github.com/alexge233/cuANN
