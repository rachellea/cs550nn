# cs550nn

Course project exploring use of GPUs for neural network training, convolution, and linear algebra. 

Neural networks: We developed a CUDA implementation of a neural network, based on "Genann." Genann is a neural network originally written in ANSI C by 'codeplea.' For the original C implementation you can visit https://github.com/codeplea/genann.

Convolution: We developed CUDA convolution code. The CUDA convolution code was not based on any other repositories.

Note: we also have a copy of cuANN in this repository. CuANN was written by 'alexge233': https://github.com/alexge233/cuANN
